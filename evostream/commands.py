    This will try to pull in a stream from an external source. Once a stream
    has been successfully pulled it is assigned a 'local stream name' which can

        unicast/multicast (d) mpegts
    :type uri: str

    :param keepAlive: If keepAlive is set to 1, the server will attempt to
        reestablish connection with astream source after a connection has been
        lost. The reconnect will be attempted once every second

        be forced. Otherwise the transport mechanism will be negotiated (UDP

        currently pulled stream is an audio source. Otherwise the pulled
        source is assumed as a video source
    :type isAudio: int

    :param audioCodecBytes: The audio codec setup of this RTP stream if it is
        audio. Represented as hex format without '0x' or 'h'. For example:

        should be base 64 encoded.

        when doing UDP based pull
    :type ssmIp: str

        value combination specifies an RTSP HTTP Proxy from which the RTSP
        stream should be pulled from Self - Specifying "self" as the value
        implies pulling RTSP over HTTP
